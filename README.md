## 🚖 Taxi Booking System

A Java-based, design-pattern-driven **Taxi Booking System** developed as part of the **CSF304 (Design Patterns)** module under the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (AI Development & Data Science, Year III, Semester II) at **Gyalpozhing College of Information Technology**, Bhutan.

Welcome to the Taxi Booking System. The Taxi Booking System is a software solution designed to facilitate efficient booking and management of taxi services. It provides a platform for customers to book rides, drivers to accept and reject the booking, and administrators to oversee the entire operation. The system is built using various design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.



## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a user-friendly **online taxi booking system** utilizing **Java** and core **design patterns** to ensure a scalable, modular, and maintainable architecture. Features include:

- 🚕 Booking Rides (Passenger)
- 👤 Driver Ride Management
- 💳 Online Payments
- 🔔 Notification System
- 🧠 Real-Time Status Tracking

The system integrates several key **design patterns** including:
- Factory
- Singleton
- Observer
- State
- Command
- Strategy
